This is a fast, facilitated introduction to design thinking methods and mindsets. It takes at least 1 hour, but is flexible based on your timing. It is geared towards participants who are new to this kind of exercise.

Read the Facilitator's Guide for information about how to run it. The Facilitator's Guide assumes that you have done at least a little bit of design facilitation before.
