This is a fast, facilitated introduction to design thinking methods and mindsets. It takes at least 1 hour, but is flexible based on your timing. It is geared towards participants who are new to this kind of exercise.

Read the Facilitator's Guide for information about how to run it. The Facilitator's Guide assumes that you have done at least a little bit of design facilitation before.

If you have changes or feedback, don't email Molly and ask her to make changes! This is open-source, and that means YOU make the changes. For more info, look in the directory called "Experiences and Notes."
