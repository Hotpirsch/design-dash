*The Design Dash is open-source.*

This means that, instead of giving me (Molly) "feedback" on the exercise, you should just change it yourself and post your changes.

So if you'd like to share what you did with the Design Dash, just upload something to this folder. You can upload a revised PowerPoint, or you can just type your comments into a text file like this one. Including your name and contact info is especially appreciated.

*How do I contribute?*

If you've never worked on an open-source project on GitHub before, awesome â€“ this is a great opportunity to learn! 
- Here's how to add a single text file: https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github
- Here's how to add/edit more files: https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/My-first-Pull-Request
- Here's how to add/edit more files without using the command line: https://pixelpioneers.co/blog/2017/using-github-without-the-command-line

If you really don't want to learn to use GitHub, you can email me (here@molly.is) and I'll post stuff for you.
